# Dataset
All emojis designed by [OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org/) â€“ the open-source emoji and icon project. License: CC BY-SA 4.0

The emoji image is 72 * 72 pixels with 10 pixels of meaningless margin on both sides of row and columns.  
The image of emoji after cropped is 52 * 52 pixels.  

# Run-time Environment
All the code is in form of **Jupyter Notebook** and the code was programed in the **Google Colab**. The file `requirements.txt` contains the specific version of each python library used.  

The Python standard libraries imported in this code are the default versions provided by Google Colab. However, as time passes, Google Colab's default Python standard library might update to newer versions, potentially deprecating older libraries and causing incompatibility or conflicts. Therefore, after testing the code, I added the following code to prevent conflicts.  

**Set-up Environment for the odel based on TensorFlow**   
`!pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caochengrui/Object_Classification_and_Localiztion_on_Emoji_Dataset/refs/heads/main/PyTorch/requirements.txt`  

**Set-up Environment for the odel based on PyTorch**  
`!pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caochengrui/Object_Classification_and_Localiztion_on_Emoji_Dataset/refs/heads/main/PyTorch/requirements.txt` 

Please ensure that specific versions of the libraries are installed when running the code.
